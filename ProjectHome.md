_**Crux**_ is a component framework created over [GWT](http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit) for fast development of web applications.

The last release of Crux 5 is available to [download](http://www.cruxframework.org/#topMenuDisposal:download). The Crux 5 version brings a number of improvements over the previous version, such as: the concept of views, support for offline applications and support the communication through REST.

# What can **_Crux_** do? #

_**Crux**_ allows you to create web user interfaces in a declarative and modularized way, which drastically improves development speed and code maintainability. In other words, it brings you the best of both worlds: the comfort of creating pages with HTML and the elegance of controlling those pages using Java code.

For an overview of it's features, take a look at the [Crux Showcase 5](http://showcase5.cruxframework.org/)

Some features provided by **_Crux_** are:
  * An innovative template mechanism, which enables the reuse of HTML pages;
  * A set of powerful client widgets, like data grids, wizards and tabbed pages;
  * Support for cross-Module and cross-Document communication;
  * Automatic binding of values between page widgets and controller's value objects;
  * Declarative event handling;
  * Declarative internationalization;
  * Validation engine, based on Java annotations;
  * Front Controller approach on client side;
  * Support for data sources to widgets;
  * Easy integration with other back end frameworks, like [spring](http://www.springsource.org), [guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/) or anything else.
  * A better MVC approach, where the controllers reside on the client side of the application;
  * Support for Open Social Gadgets creation;

When we talk about controllers residing on the client, we are talking about faster applications. Unlike most existing Web MVC frameworks, GWT-based solutions can manipulate the user interface where it is cheapest to be done: directly and entirely within the browser, without accessing the server. This means you only call the server to send and receive business data.

As mentioned earlier, _**Crux**_ has a set of rich client widgets. But there's more: all GWT widgets are available for using with _**Crux**_, declaratively. Furthermore, it is easy to create new widgets or even plug in an already existent set of them. For more information about custom widgets, take a look at the [Widget Developer Manual](WidgetDeveloperManual.md).
